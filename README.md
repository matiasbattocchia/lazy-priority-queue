# Lazy priority queue

Lazy priority queue is a priority queue which implements a lazy binomial heap.
It supports the change priority operation, being suitable for algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and Prim's minimum spanning tree.
It can be instantiated as a min-priority queue as well as a max-priority queue.

## Installation

With RubyGems:

```ruby
gem install 'lazy_priority_queue'
```

## Usage

First instantiate a priority queue.

```ruby
require 'lazy_priority_queue'

queue = MinPriorityQueue.new
```

There is also a `MaxPriorityQueue` class.

Use `enqueue(element, priority)` to insert an element with a given priority to the queue.

```ruby
queue.enqueue :a, 1
queue.enqueue :b, 2
queue.enqueue :c, 3
```

`peek()` will retrieve the minimum priority element without removing it from the queue.

```ruby
queue.peek # => :a
```

`change_priority(element, new_priority)` decreases an element's priority.

```ruby
queue.change_priority :c, 0
```

Use `dequeue()` to extract the minimum priority element from the queue.

```ruby
queue.dequeue # => :c
queue.dequeue # => :a
queue.dequeue # => :b
```

Finally, there are these aditional instance methods: `delete(element)`, `size` and `empty?`.

## Complexity

Operation | Time
--------- | ----
enqueue | O(1)
peek | O(1)
change_priority | O(log n)
dequeue | O(log n) amortized
delete | O(log n) amortized

Note: The Fibonacci heap has better amortized time for change priority, O(1) namely, but each node in this heap stores more pointers to other nodes than binomial heap ones, making it more memory consuming.
